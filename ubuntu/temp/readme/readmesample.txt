<h2>Competition Scenario</h2>

<p>
You work for the secret spy agency O.W.C.A., otherwise known as the 
Organization Without a Cool Acronym. Its mission is to stop evil scientists 
from carrying out their diabolical plans.
</p>

<p>
O.W.C.A.&#39;s security policies require that all user accounts be 
password protected. Employees are required to choose secure passwords, however 
this policy may not be currently enforced on this computer. The presence of 
any non-work related media files and &quot;hacking tools&quot; on any 
computers is strictly prohibited.  This company currently does not use any 
centralized maintenance or polling tools to manage their IT equipment. This 
computer is for official business use only by authorized users.  Your job is 
to secure this computer, within the guidelines of the scenario, while ensuring 
the availability of authorized business critical software and services.
</p>

<h2>Ubuntu 22.04</h2>

<p>
It is company policy to use only Ubuntu 22.04 on this computer. It is also 
company policy to use only the latest, official, stable Ubuntu 22.04 packages 
available for required software and services on this computer. The display 
manager should remain set to GDM3. 
</p>

<p>
Major Monogram, your boss, has decided that the default web browser for all 
users on this computer should be the latest stable version of Firefox. Firefox 
must remain installed using the official Mozilla PPA, and NOT as a SNAP 
package. Employees must also have access to the latest stable version of 
Thunderbird and Perl to securely support top secret activities. The only 
company approved firewall for this computer is UFW. Company policy is to never 
let users log in as root. If administrators need to run commands as root, they 
are required to use the &quot;sudo&quot; command.
